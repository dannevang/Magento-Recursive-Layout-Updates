# Exanto Reclayup
#
This extension fixes the issue that custom XML layout updates are not applied
to child elements (categories, products) even if the parent is configured to to so.

#
# Notes
#
This module extends the Mage_Catalog_Model_Product and Mage_Catalog_Model_Category Models.
If you have other extensions doing the same you might get a race condition and have
to alter your existing modules. To fix this, just put the three methods from my models
into the conflicting one and delete my extension afterwards.
